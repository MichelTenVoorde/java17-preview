## Welcome
Every covered topic has got its own package. Rather than predictable and boring exercices, these contain some examples
in which the topic at hand is being demonstrated. Use these to play around yourself. Trying to break something
is often the best way to get to know something new.

## Links to covered topics
The slides only offer a sneak peek at the new features. The Java Enhancement Proposals (JEPs)
are very readable, so if you're interested, give these links a go:
